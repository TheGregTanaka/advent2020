My solutions for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about). Doing it in Rust to learn the language, I expect much of this will be dirty af, 

To keep things simple, I'm just setting up each day as it's own project, `cargo new dayXX` so to run any given solution, simply `cd dayXX && cargo run < input/input.txt`
